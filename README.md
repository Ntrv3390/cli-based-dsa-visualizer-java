# A CLI Based Data Structures & Algorithm Visualizer

Hi, welcome to dsa visualizer. In this project you can find all the
major data structures such as arrays, linkedlists, trees, graphs,
tries, and hashmaps.

# Visualizing Arrays

A file name myArrays.java contains the algorithms for adding, traversing,
sorting, & searching.

Searching Array:

-- Searching is done in two ways:
   1: Using Linear Search
   2: Using Binary Search

Sorting Array:

-- Sorting is done in two ways:
   1: Using Merge Sort
   2: Using Quick Sort

# Visualizing LinkedLists

A file name myLL.java contains the algorithms for adding, traversing & searching
in a LinkedList.

Adding Node in LinkedList:

-- Adding is done in three ways
   1: Adding node at beginning
   2: Adding node at last
   3: Adding node at a given index

Removing Node from LinkedList:

-- Removing is done in three ways
   1: Removing node from beginning
   2: Removing node from last
   3: Removing node from a given index

Searching LinkedList:

-- Searching is done in two ways:
   1: Using Iterative Search
   2: Using Recursive Search

# Visualizing Stacks

A file name myStack.java contains the algorithms for adding, traversing & searching
in a Stack.

Adding Node in Stack:

-- Node is always added at the top of the stack.

Removing Node from Stack:

-- Node is always removed from the top of the stack.

-- Stack follows LIFO (Last In First Out) Structure.

Searching Stack:

-- Searching is done in two ways:
   1: Using Iterative Search
   2: Using Recursive Search

# Visualizing Queues

A file name myQueue.java contains the algorithms for adding, traversing & searching
in a Queue.

Adding Node in Queue:

-- Node is always added at the front of the queue.

Removing Node from Queue:

-- Node is always removed from the rear of the queue.

-- Queue follows FIFO (First In First Out) Structure.

Searching Queue:

-- Searching is done in two ways:
   1: Using Iterative Search
   2: Using Recursive Search

# Visualizing Trees

A file name myTrees.java contains the algorithms for adding, traversing and counting the
nodes and data of the nodes in a tree. 

Adding Node in Trees:

-- Node is first added to the root node and then the left and right child.

Traversing The Tree

-- Traversing is done in four ways:
   1: Using Preorder (recursive)
   2: Using Inorder (recursive)
   3: Using Postorder (recursive)
   4: Using Levelorder (iterative)
