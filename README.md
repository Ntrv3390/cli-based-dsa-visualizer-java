# A CLI Based Data Structures & Algorithm Visualizer

Hi, welcome to dsa visualizer. In this project you can find all the
major data structures such as arrays, linkedlists, trees, graphs,
tries, and hashmaps.

# Visualizing Arrays

A file name myArrays.java contains the algorithms for adding, traversing,
sorting, & searching.

Searching Array:

-- Searching is done in two ways
   1: Using Linear Search
   2: Using Binary Search

Sorting Array:

-- Sorting is done in two ways
   1: Using Merge Sort
   2: Using Quick Sort

# Visualizing LinkedLists

A file name myLL.java contains the algorithms for adding, traversing & searching
in a LinkedList.

Adding Node in LinkedList:

-- Adding is done in three ways
   1: Adding node at beginning
   2: Adding node at last
   3: Adding node at a given index

Removing Node from LinkedList:

-- Removing is done in three ways
   1: Removing node from beginning
   2: Removing node from last
   3: Removing node from a given index

Searching LinkedList:

-- Searching is done in two ways
   1: Using Iterative Search
   2: Using Recursive Search


# More coming soon!
