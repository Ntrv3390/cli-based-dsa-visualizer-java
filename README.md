# A CLI Based Data Structures & Algorithm Visualizer

Hi, welcome to dsa visualizer. In this project you can find all the
major data structures such as arrays, linkedlists, trees, graphs,
tries, and hashmaps.

# Visualizing Arrays

A file name myArrays.java contains the algorithms for adding, traversing,
sorting, & searching.

In this project I have used Linear Search & Binary Search for searching &
for sorting I have used Merge Sort & Quick Sort.

# More coming soon!


# Thank you for visualizing!
